## Introduction
* [click to watch demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEFvWzdaVEM&t=2s)
* This APP demonstrates Big Active Data (BAD) concept by utilizing the continuous query and data ingestion capabilities of Asterix DB.
* It offers a notification service to users when their Twitter friends are nearby so they can meet at a nearby coffee shop.Users can subscribe to a channel created by Broker (i.e. Followers/Followees). When followers or followees are approaching a userâ€™s location, Broker sends a notification to users and displays them on the mobile map. The application also marks the coffee shops (Starbucks) nearby. Thus, users can send a message through the application and invite friends to meet at a coffee shop.
